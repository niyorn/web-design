## Description
This porfolio is a prototype project where we will create a simple portfolio site that will follow some of the [design principle](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-user-interface-design/) of Joshua porter

The design principle that we will focus on are:
* One primary action per screen
* Appearance follows behavior
* Strong visual hierachies works best
